Prefactor: Preprocessing for Facet Calibration for LOFAR
========================================================

Preactor consists of parsets for the genericpipeline (see
http://www.astron.nl/citt/genericpipeline) that do the first calibration of
LOFAR data. Originally in order to prepare said data for the Factor facet
calibration, but also useful if you don't plan to run Factor.
