Capabilities of prefactor
=========================

Prefactor derives and corrects for direction-independent effects in LOFAR data,
including clock offsets and bandpass calibration. The output data are suitable
for processing further with direction-dependent calibration.

Prefactor was designed to work on compute clusters and allows for the
distribution of jobs over multiple nodes of a cluster.
