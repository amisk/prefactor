.. _parset:

Editing the pipeline parset
===========================

The pipeline parsets available in the Prefactor directory (those files ending
with ".parset") are templates of genericpipeline parsets and need some minor
editing before they can be run. All parameters that
need to be changed are defined at the top of the parset with lines beginning
with ``!``. See the comments in the pipeline parsets for some hints on setting
these parameters.

See :ref:`pipeline_overview` for an overview of the pipeline parsets, and their
respective pages for a more in-depth description.
