Data preparation
================

.. note::

    Processing of interleaved or multi-night datasets is not currently supported.

Prefactor requires LOFAR LBA or HBA data. These data are typically obtained from
the LOFAR Long-Term Archive at https://lta.lofar.eu. All input measurement-sets
for one pipeline run need to be in the same directory.
